Decorations override

<body style='font-family:"Segoe UI"'>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Overriding decorations is a way for you to tell <b>Armory</b> how many jewels you have of each kind, but it is possible to override only some of them, instead of having to redefine all of them.<br/><br/>

By default, if you do not activate <b><span style="color:blue">decorations override</span></b>, <b>Armory</b> considers you have an infinite amount of each kind or jewel. If you activate <b><span style=" color:blue">decorations override</span></b> on the main window, then only checked jewels in the <b><span style=" color:blue">decorations override</span></b> window will be considered with the amount you entered.<br/><br/>

For example, if you activate <b><span style="color:blue">decorations override</span></b> but check no jewel, this has no effect. However, if you check the <b><span style="color:orange">Attack Boost</span></b> jewel and type 1 in the amount, <b>Armory</b> will consider you have an infinite amount of all jewels (except the <b><span style="color:orange">Attack Boost</span></b> one) and that you have only 1 <b><span style="color:orange">Attack Boost</span></b> jewel.<br/><br/>

Another example is if you want to tell <b>Armory</b> to not use <b><span style="color:orange">Mind's Eyes</span></b> because you do not have it, check <b><span style="color:orange">Mind's Eyes</span></b> and enter 0 in the amount. In such a case, <b>Armory</b> will not use <b><span style="color:orange">Mind's Eyes</span></b>, but will still consider you have plenty of all other jewels.

<h3>Import jewels</h3>

For PC players, you can import jewels from your save data. At the bottom of the <b><span style="color:blue">decorations override</span></b> window, click the <span style="color:green">Import from save...</span> button.<br/><br/>

If you have only one account with only one save data, then your save data slot is imported. Otherwise, a selector window may open to let you choose which one you want to import.
