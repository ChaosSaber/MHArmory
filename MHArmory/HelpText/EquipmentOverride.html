Equipment override

<body style='font-family:"Segoe UI"'>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Overriding equipment is a way for you to tell <b>Armory</b> to exclude some armor pieces and charms in your research for sets that match your desired skills.<br/><br/>

By default, if you do not activate <b><span style="color:blue">equipment override</span></b>, <b>Armory</b> considers you have all equipments, based on the <b><span style="color:orange">events</span></b> selection you made. If you activate <b><span style=" color:blue">equipment override</span></b> on the main window, then only checked equipment in the <b><span style=" color:blue">equipment override</span></b> window will be taken into account in search results. Note that <b><span style="color:orange">events</span></b> are still taken into account for exclusion.<br/><br/>

If you activate <b><span style="color:blue">equipment override</span></b> and check all equipments, this will produce the same result as with the feature disabled.<br/><br/>

<h3>Import equipment</h3>

For PC players, you can import equipment from your save data. At the bottom of the <b><span style="color:blue">equipment override</span></b> window, click the <span style="color:green">Import...</span> button.<br/><br/>

If you have only one account with only one save data, then your save data slot is imported. Otherwise, a selector window may open to let you choose which one you want to import.
