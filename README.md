# Overview

This project is something I've always wanted to develop.

The main motivation to do it has been led by the marvelous [Athena's ASS][10] application. If you do not know it, it's a shame, but it's never too late to give it a try.

There are some parts in [Athena's ASS][10] I think could be improved, and for programming language preference reasons, I decided to make my own application, in order to make it the way I want. Note that the data used by **Armory** is the one provided by [Athena's ASS][10].

Also, I want to make **Armory** a community driven project, for people to be able to give their opinion and request features, thus open sourcing it on GitHub.

# How to contribute

For any bug report or feature request, please fill an issue [here][9].

If you are a developer and want to contribute to code, I recommend to first open an [issue][9] to describe the problem to solve or feature to be implemented, before implementing it, in order to discuss about it.
