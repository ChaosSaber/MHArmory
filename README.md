# Overview

This project is something I've always wanted to develop.

The main motivation to do it has been lead by the marvelous [Athena's ASS][10] application. If you do not know it, it's a shame, but it's never too late to give it a try.

There are some parts in [Athena's ASS][10] that I don't like, and I wanted to contribute to help improve things that should be improved. Therefore, I tried to contact the author(s), but unsuccessfully. So, I decided to make my own, and make it the way I want.

Also, I want to make **Armory** a community driven project, for people to be able to give their opinion and request features, thus open sourcing it on GitHub.

# How to contribute

For any bug report or feature request, please fill an issue [here][9].

If you are a developer and want to contribute to code, I recommend to first open an [issue][9] to describe the feature to be implemented before implementing it, in order to discuss about it.

# How to use

The documentation of **Armory** is currently being written.<br/>
This document will be updated soon to link to documentation.
