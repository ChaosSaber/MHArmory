# MH Armory

## Overview

**Armory** is an Armor Set Search application, or often said ASS.

This is a free and open-source project for the community to contribute and propose ideas.<br/>
Have a look at the GitHub project here: [https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory](https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory)

For the time being, **Armory** requires the data from the very good `Athena's ASS` application to work. This will change in the future.<br/>
Since I do not want to "steal" `Athena's ASS` data, you fist have to download it yourself, then indicate to **Armory** where data is located.

If you do not know about `Athena's ASS`, better late than never, you can find it here: [https://sabercathost.com/folder/70912/MHW](https://sabercathost.com/folder/70912/MHW)

**Armory** supports only `Monster Hunter: World`.

## Run Armory

To begin with, download `Athena's ASS` and extract wherever you see fit.<br/>
Let's assume you extracted it to the location `D:\MHW\Athena's Armor Set Search for MHW v0.54b` like bellow, for the sake of the example.

![Athena's ASS directory content](images/athena_ass_directory_content.png)

Then, download the zip file of **Armory** at this address: [https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory/raw/master/Distributions/MHArmory_0.0.4.0.zip](https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory/raw/master/Distributions/MHArmory_0.0.4.0.zip)

Extract the zip at a location where the application will have write access rights, for it to store your preferences. This is not mandatory, but recommended.<br/>
Avoid `Program Files` or such.

Once extracted, you should have something like this:

![Armory directory content](images/armory_directory_content.png)

From now on, you can execute `MHArmory.exe`.<br/>
A dialog box should open, as follow:

![Data access dialog](images/data_access_dlg01.png)

You can click `Cancel` to reject the request, this will shutdown the application.<br/>
Click `OK` to proceed.

Then, another dialog box asks for the location of the data directory of `Athena's ASS`, as follow:

![Data access dialog](images/data_access_dlg02.png)

You can select the directory `Athena's Armor Set Search for MHW vX` (example on the image above) or the `Data` sub directory.

Then click `OK` and it is done, you can now use **Armory**.<br/>
This procedure has to be done only once.
