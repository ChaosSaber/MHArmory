# MH Armory

## Overview

**Armory** is an Armor Set Search application, or often said ASS.

This is a free and open-source project for the community to contribute and propose ideas.<br/>
Have a look at the GitHub project here: [https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory](https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory)

**Armory** supports only `Monster Hunter: World`.

## Run Armory

First, download the zip file of **Armory** at this address: [https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory/raw/master/Distributions/MHArmory_0.0.5.1.zip](https://github.com/TanukiSharp/MHArmory/raw/master/Distributions/MHArmory_0.0.5.1.zip)

Extract the zip at a location where the application will have write access rights, for it to store your preferences. This is optional, but recommended.<br/>
Avoid `Program Files` or such.

From now on, you can execute `MHArmory.exe`.<br/>
